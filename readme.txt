With my collegaues, I designed PCB to interactive chessboard.

The designed board should detect a given game piece on its field and, on this basis, send data to the microcontroller.
The microcontroller processes the data and determines the possible movements.
Depending on this, the board should glow with the appropriate LED color, e.g. red - a pawn to capture.
